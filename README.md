# R-Projects-Linear-Regression

A linear regression was performed on mouse weight and size. The multiple R squared value was found to be 61.33% which means that weight can explain 61% of the variation in mouse size.
A p-value of 0.01256 was obtained which implies that weight gives us a reliable estimate for size.
